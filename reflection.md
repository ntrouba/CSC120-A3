- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

 For this assignment I consulted with Lily Garner and Liberty Lehr. Lily and I attended the office hours on 9/25 from 7-9 and got help from Dakota. I struggled a bit with getting the conversation to execute for the right number of times but I figured out it was because of where my scanner closed. For future students, I recommend starting out with pseudocode because they know how to do this in Python but starting with pseudocode will make it easier to learn how to do what they want in Java.

 I can't truly give you my "initial" impression of Java because funnily enough Java was my first programming language back in AP CSA my junior year of high school. It's been awhile since I've used it but it's fun to be programming with it again because I believe it offers more options than Python.
 
 That transitions into the next question about the similarities between Python and Java. For me, it's about the same just different language to do the same things as before. Programming is just telling a computer to do things and just as there are different human languages there are several programming ones, each offering there own strengths and weaknesses.
